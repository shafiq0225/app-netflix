  Netflix Clone Built Using Angular 18
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a clone of Netflix website built using <strong><em>Angular 18</em></strong> as a Front-end & It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, browse page, and movie player.
